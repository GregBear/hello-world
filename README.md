1) I also added an EDIT function for completeness. 2) The database must be called ‘phone’. 3) The credentials to log in are at the top of the file ‘dbheader.php’, please change to your credentials, 4) The client side validation checks for empty fields. 5) The server side validation also checks that the name fields are not numeric and the number fields are numeric. 6) The .sql file ‘phone.sql’ is in the src/phone/db folder. This document is in the src/phone/doc folder.
